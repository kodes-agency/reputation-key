## Stack

TanStack Start (SSR + server functions + routing) on Railway Node. Drizzle + Neon Postgres. better-auth (organization plugin, DB-backed sessions). BullMQ + Redis for jobs, rate limiting, and caching. Cloudflare R2 for storage. Resend for email. FCM for push. Anthropic for AI. Pure functional style; `neverthrow` for `Result`, `ts-pattern` for union dispatch, `Zod` for validation. **TanStack Form + shadcn/ui for all forms.** TanStack Query for client-side cache and mutations.

> **Note on Zod version:** This project uses Zod v4 (`^4.3.6`). TanStack Form v1 handles Zod schemas natively — pass the schema directly to `validators.onSubmit`. No adapter library is needed.

## Bounded contexts

`identity`, `property`, `team`, `staff`, `portal`, `guest`, `review`, `metric`, `gamification`, `notification`, `ai`, `audit`.

Each context owns its data, rules, events, errors, and public API. Contexts communicate via domain events. Cross-context type imports allowed for events only.

Contexts vary in "thickness": thick contexts (`portal`, `review`, `metric`) own their tables and have their own domain logic; thin contexts (`identity`) primarily wrap a third-party library. Thin contexts will legitimately have empty layer folders (no mappers, no jobs, sparse use cases). That's expected.

---

## The four layers

| Layer             | Contains                                                                                                                                                        | Forbidden                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `domain/`         | Types, pure rules, smart constructors, events, errors. Additional pure-function files (e.g., `permissions.ts`) when content warrants splitting from `rules.ts`. | `async`, I/O, framework imports, `throw`, mutation        |
| `application/`    | Use cases, port interfaces, DTOs                                                                                                                                | DB queries, HTTP code, React, reimplementing domain rules |
| `infrastructure/` | Repository impls, mappers, adapters, job handlers, event handlers                                                                                               | Business rules, HTTP routing, React                       |
| `server/`         | TanStack Start server functions                                                                                                                                 | Business logic, direct DB access, domain rules            |

Dependencies point inward: `routes` → `server` → `application` → `domain`. Infrastructure implements `application` ports. Domain depends on nothing outside itself and `shared/domain/`.

**Empty layer folders are fine.** Wrapper contexts may have no mappers, no jobs, no repositories. Only create files when they have content.

---

## When to skip layers

Not every operation needs every layer. The patterns are tools, not rituals. Use this guide:

| Operation shape                                                                                     | Pattern                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pure third-party delegation (no auth check, no event, no transformation)                            | Server function may call the port (or third-party API) directly. Examples: sign-in, sign-out, request password reset. |
| Authorization check + delegation, nothing else                                                      | Keep the use case, even if it's effectively one line. The use case is the place future logic will land.               |
| Has business rules, multi-field validation, events, cross-entity coordination, or state transitions | Full use case with the 7-step pattern.                                                                                |

**When in doubt, prefer the use case.** A one-line use case costs three extra lines. Business logic leaking into server functions costs you weeks of refactoring later.

**The 7-step use case pattern is a template, not a law.** If a step doesn't apply, skip it; don't fake it. Most use cases will have 4–6 of the 7 steps. That's fine.

---

## Forms

All forms in the app use **TanStack Form + Zod + shadcn/ui**. This is the only supported form stack — don't use React Hook Form, Formik, or plain `useState` forms.

### Rules

1. **Schema source:** The Zod schema lives in `contexts/<ctx>/application/dto/`. It's the single source of truth for the server's input shape. The form may define its own schema when the form shape differs (e.g., all fields as strings, no optional fields), but validation rules (lengths, formats, ranges) must match what the domain enforces. See `docs/patterns.md` section 29 for the full guidance.

2. **Form components:** Built using shadcn's Field components (`Field`, `FieldGroup`, `FieldLabel`, `FieldError`, `FieldDescription`) wired with TanStack Form's `form.Field` render prop. Follow shadcn's official TanStack Form integration docs.

3. **Submission:** Every form submission goes through a TanStack Query `useMutation` wrapping a server function. **The mutation is defined in the route file and passed to the form component as a prop.** Never call server functions directly from form handlers. Never define mutations inside components (dependency rules forbid `components/` from importing `server/`).

4. **Validation trigger:** Use `validators.onSubmit` (not `onChange`) so errors only appear after the user submits. This avoids showing errors while the user is still filling in the form. TanStack Form v1 handles Zod schemas natively — just pass the Zod schema directly, no adapter needed.

5. **Form-level state:** Mutation state (`isPending`, `isError`, `isSuccess`, `error`) drives submit button state and top-level error display. Never manage `isSubmitting` yourself.

6. **Shared building blocks** live in `components/forms/`:
   - `SubmitButton` — wraps shadcn `Button`, reads mutation state, shows spinner when pending
   - `FormErrorBanner` — displays top-level mutation errors (translates tagged errors to user messages)
   - `FormSection` — visual grouping for long forms
   - Additional wrappers as patterns emerge — but only after a second form needs the same thing

7. **Feature-specific forms** live in `components/features/<context>/` alongside other feature UI (e.g., `CreatePortalForm.tsx`, `InviteMemberForm.tsx`).

8. **Public forms** (guest rating, feedback) follow the same pattern but submit to public server functions without auth middleware.

See `docs/patterns.md` for a canonical form example (portal create form).

If a file would import from two contexts' internals, you're doing something wrong. Use events or rethink the boundary.

---

## Functional style

**Locked:**

- No `class`. No `this`. No inheritance. No `enum` (use string literal unions).
- Prefer `type` aliases over `interface` for consistency. Interfaces are not forbidden but are not the default.
- `readonly` on all domain type fields. `ReadonlyArray<T>` for arrays in domain.
- Immutable updates only. Never mutate parameters.
- Discriminated unions tagged with `_tag`.
- `Result<T, E>` from neverthrow in domain. Throw tagged errors at application boundary.
- `match(...).exhaustive()` from ts-pattern for all union dispatch.
- Repositories are records of functions returned by factory functions: `createXxxRepository(db)`.
- Use cases are factory functions: `(deps) => async (input, ctx) => Promise<T>`.

**Pragmatic:**

- `async/await` allowed in application and infrastructure.
- Closures over mutable state allowed anywhere when hidden behind a pure interface (event bus, testable clock, in-memory fakes, etc.).
- React hooks not purified.

**Forbidden:**

- `class` (except React error boundaries if absolutely required).
- `enum`.
- Mutation of function parameters.
- Implicit `any`.
- `as` casts except for branded ID parsing.
- `// @ts-ignore` without an explanatory comment.
- `require()` — use ESM `import`.

---

## Tenant isolation

1. Every business table has `organization_id` (non-null).
2. Every repository method takes `organizationId: OrganizationId` as the first parameter.
3. Every repository query filters `WHERE organization_id = $1 AND deleted_at IS NULL` (use `baseWhere(orgId)` helper in `shared/db/base-where.ts`).
4. `resolveTenantContext(headers)` resolves org from session and returns `AuthContext`. Server functions call this at the top of their handler.
5. Public routes resolve org from URL slug, validate via use case logic (no auth context).
6. Every repository has an integration test that attempts a cross-tenant query and asserts empty result.

No ambient tenant context. No inferring tenant from entity ID. Always explicit.

---

## Use case shape

Every use case follows this order, **including only the steps that apply**:

1. Authorize (call domain rule)
2. Validate referenced entities exist (call repos) — including loading the target of the operation if a role check depends on its current state
3. Check uniqueness / business invariants (call repos)
4. Build domain object via smart constructor (returns `Result`, throw tagged error on `.isErr()`)
5. Persist (call repo)
6. Emit event
7. Return result

Most use cases will use 4–6 of these steps. A pure delegation use case might be just (1) + (5). A query use case might be just (1) + (5) + (7). Skip the steps that don't apply; don't add ceremony for symmetry.

The order matters when steps are present, because it reflects the natural dependency chain.

**Anonymous/public use cases** (registration, public guest flows) omit the `AuthContext` parameter entirely — they take only `(input)`, not `(input, ctx)`. These have no authorization step and no tenant context. The server function resolves the org from other sources (URL slug for public routes) or creates a new org (for registration).

---

## Events

- Past-tense facts: `portal.created`, `review.received`, `goal.achieved`. Never commands.
- Live in emitting context's `domain/events.ts`. Master union in `shared/events/events.ts`.
- Constructors enforce the `_tag`: `portalCreated({ ... })`.
- Subscribers live in **receiving** context's `infrastructure/event-handlers/`.
- Handlers are idempotent.
- Handlers don't throw; they log via the shared logger (`shared/observability/logger.ts`), not `console`.
- For durable / scheduled / retryable work, the handler enqueues a BullMQ job rather than doing the work inline.
- The event bus is wired in `composition.ts` and passed to use cases via deps. Use cases emit directly; they do not check whether the bus is available.

## Errors

| Layer            | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain           | Returns `Result<T, DomainError>`. Never throws.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Application      | Throws tagged errors on `Result.isErr()`. Awaits async normally.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Infrastructure   | Catches library errors, translates to tagged errors or lets them bubble.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Server functions | Catches tagged errors, pattern-matches `_tag` and `code`, **throws an `Error`** with `.name`, `.message`, `.code`, and `.status` properties. TanStack Start serializes Errors via seroval and re-throws on the client, so mutations fail correctly. |

Tagged error shape: `{ _tag: 'XxxError', code: '<reason>', message: string, context?: Record<string, unknown> }`. Errors built only via the smart constructor (e.g., `portalError(code, message)`).

Translate errors to HTTP using `match(e.code).with(...).exhaustive()` so adding a new code forces a compiler-checked update.

**Never return `{ success: false, error: message }` from server functions.** Always throw Error objects. TanStack Start's seroval serialization transports them to the client where mutations fail and `mutation.error` is populated with the Error (including `.message`).

| Domain constructors  | `buildXxx`                   | `buildPortal`, `buildMetricReading`    |
| Event constructors   | past-tense matches `_tag`    | `portalCreated`, `reviewReceived`      |

Exception: better-auth tables use camelCase columns (framework default). Everything else is snake_case.

Every business table includes: `id`, `organization_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. Soft-deletable tables include `deleted_at`.

## Dependency rules (enforced by lint)

- `domain/` imports nothing outside `domain/` and `shared/domain/`.
- `application/` imports from `domain/`, `shared/domain/`.
- `infrastructure/` imports from `domain/`, `application/`, `shared/`, external libs.
- `server/` imports from `application/` (use cases, dtos), `shared/`, TanStack Start.
- `routes/` imports from `contexts/<ctx>/server/` (server functions only — not domain, application, infrastructure), `components/`, `shared/`.
- `components/` imports from other `components/`, `shared/`, `contexts/<ctx>/application/dto/` (to derive form schemas). Never from domain, application (non-dto), infrastructure, or server.
- `shared/` imports from itself and external libs only. **Exception:** `shared/events/events.ts` imports context event types (`domain/events.ts`) to build the master `DomainEvent` union — this is the only allowed cross-context type import in shared.

Forbidden:

- `contexts/A/<non-server-non-dto>` from `contexts/B/*`
- `drizzle-orm` outside `infrastructure/`
- React outside `routes/` and `components/`
- Direct DB access in `routes/` or `components/`
- `shared/testing/*` from production code

## Testing

| Layer            | Type                                     | Test-first?                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Domain           | Pure unit, no setup                      | Yes, always                       |
| Use cases        | Unit with in-memory port fakes           | Yes, default                      |
| Repositories     | Integration vs real Postgres             | Test-after, but always test       |
| Adapters         | Integration with mocked external API     | Test-after                        |
| Server functions | Integration through TanStack Start       | Test-after critical paths         |
| Forms            | Component tests with user-event, minimal | Test-after for complex validation |
| UI (other)       | Sparse, pragmatic                        | No                                |
| E2E              | Playwright critical flows                | No, after feature works           |

Required per context: 100% coverage on domain rules / constructors / errors. Every use case tested for happy path + every error path. Every repository method has integration test. Tenant isolation test per repository.

Tests colocated: `rules.ts` next to `rules.test.ts`.

## Anti-patterns

- Adding non-orchestration logic to a use case → belongs in `domain/`.
- Repository importing another context's types → boundary is wrong, or relationship is application-level.
- Inlining a query in a route → always go through a server function.
- Skipping the port "for now" when there's real domain logic → couples use case to implementation, breaks testability. (Different from intentional thin delegation in wrapper contexts, which is fine.)
- Event handler in the emitting context → handlers belong in the receiving context.
- Putting code in `shared/` "we might need it" → wait for the second importer.
- Throwing plain `Error` → always tagged errors.
- Returning `{ success: false, error: message }` from server functions → always throw Error objects (TanStack Start serializes them for the client).
- Duplicating the Zod schema between form and server function → derive the form schema from the DTO schema using `.required()` / `.extend()` / `.omit()` (see `docs/patterns.md` section 29).
- Calling server functions directly from forms without a mutation → always wrap in TanStack Query `useMutation`.
- Managing form `isSubmitting` state manually → use mutation status.
- Using React Hook Form, Formik, or plain `useState` for forms → use TanStack Form.
- `as` casts to non-branded types → types are wrong; fix them with parsing or `Result`.
- Using a class → should be a record of functions returned by a factory.
- Skipping a domain or use case test "it's obvious" → those are the cheapest tests; write them.
- Forcing every operation through 4 layers when 2 will do → ceremony, not architecture. See "When to skip layers".
- Forcing thin operations into the full pattern for symmetry → ceremony; skip absent steps.
- Inlining business logic into server functions to avoid "a one-line use case" → use a thin use case.
- Using `new Date()` in a use case → inject `clock` as a dependency. `new Date()` breaks test determinism.
- Following an AI suggestion that doesn't match this doc or existing code → ask whether it fits before accepting.

## When in doubt

1. Read existing context code for the pattern.
2. Re-read this doc.
3. If still unclear, check `docs/architecture.md` for rationale or `docs/patterns.md` for examples.
4. If the docs don't answer it, decide deliberately and update the doc _before_ writing the code.
