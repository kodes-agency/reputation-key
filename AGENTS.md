## Skill Loading

Before substantial work:

- Skill check: run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest list`, or use skills already listed in context.
- Skill guidance: if one local skill clearly matches the task, run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` and follow the returned `SKILL.md`.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.

# context-mode — MANDATORY routing rules

context-mode MCP tools available. Rules protect context window from flooding. One unrouted command dumps 56 KB into context.

## Think in Code — MANDATORY

Analyze/count/filter/compare/search/parse/transform data: **write code** via `ctx_execute(language, code)`, `console.log()` only the answer. Do NOT read raw data into context. PROGRAM the analysis, not COMPUTE it. Pure JavaScript — Node.js built-ins only (`fs`, `path`, `child_process`). `try/catch`, handle `null`/`undefined`. One script replaces ten tool calls.

## BLOCKED — do NOT attempt

### curl / wget — BLOCKED

Intercepted and replaced with error. Do NOT retry.
Use: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` or `ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "const r = await fetch(...)")`

### Inline HTTP — BLOCKED

`fetch('http`, `requests.get(`, `requests.post(`, `http.get(`, `http.request(` — intercepted. Do NOT retry.
Use: `ctx_execute(language, code)` — only stdout enters context

### WebFetch — BLOCKED

Use: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)`

## REDIRECTED — use sandbox

### Bash (>20 lines output)

Bash ONLY for: `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `npm install`, `pip install`.
Otherwise: `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` or `ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "...")`

### Read (for analysis)

Reading to **Edit** → Read correct. Reading to **analyze/explore/summarize** → `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)`.

### Grep (large results)

Use `ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "grep ...")` in sandbox.

## Tool selection

1. **GATHER**: `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — runs all commands, auto-indexes, returns search. ONE call replaces 30+. Each command: `{label: "header", command: "..."}`.
2. **FOLLOW-UP**: `ctx_search(queries: ["q1", "q2", ...])` — all questions as array, ONE call.
3. **PROCESSING**: `ctx_execute(language, code)` | `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` — sandbox, only stdout enters context.
4. **WEB**: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)` — raw HTML never enters context.
5. **INDEX**: `ctx_index(content, source)` — store in FTS5 for later search.

## Subagent routing

Routing block auto-injected into subagent prompts. Bash-type subagents upgraded to general-purpose. No manual instruction needed.

## Output

Terse like caveman. Technical substance exact. Only fluff die.
Drop: articles, filler (just/really/basically), pleasantries, hedging. Fragments OK. Short synonyms. Code unchanged.
Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step]. Auto-expand for: security warnings, irreversible actions, user confusion.
Write artifacts to FILES — never inline. Return: file path + 1-line description.
Descriptive source labels for `ctx_search(source: "label")`.

## ctx commands

| Command       | Action                                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ctx stats`   | Call `ctx_stats` MCP tool, display full output verbatim                           |
| `ctx doctor`  | Call `ctx_doctor` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist      |
| `ctx upgrade` | Call `ctx_upgrade` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist     |
| `ctx purge`   | Call `ctx_purge` MCP tool with confirm: true. Warns before wiping knowledge base. |

After /clear or /compact: knowledge base and session stats preserved. Use `ctx purge` to start fresh.

## Fallow — codebase analysis gate

Fallow (dead code, complexity, boundaries) is installed as a devDependency. Config + regression baseline: `.fallowrc.json` (206 known issues, `audit.gate: new-only`).

**After editing code, before staging/committing** — self-check the changeset:

```bash
pnpm exec fallow dead-code --changed-since origin/main --format json
```

Clean → proceed. A newly-orphaned export/file → remove it, but **confirm reachability first** with `pnpm exec fallow dead-code --trace <file>:<export> --format json`. Never delete to silence a finding.

**Pre-commit/push gate (automatic):** `.claude/hooks/fallow-gate.sh` (PreToolUse on `Bash`) runs `fallow audit` on every `git commit`/`git push` and **blocks only on `verdict: fail`** — issues your changeset _introduces_ (new-only). It fails open on runtime errors / missing binary. On block: read the JSON findings on stderr, fix, retry.

**CI gate:** `.github/workflows/fallow.yml` runs `fallow audit --gate new-only` (+ SARIF upload) on every PR — the shared source of truth.

**WIP caution:** the baseline includes unused exports/files in active work (notification/inbox/badge). Do not delete flagged WIP symbols without a `trace` confirming they are truly dead — they may be unwired-but-intended. Prefer `@expected-unused` or leave them for the feature to complete.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues at `kodes-agency/reputation-key`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Five canonical labels: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Co-located context files in the source tree:

- Root: `CONTEXT.md` — glossary, architecture overview, pointers to layer docs
- Components: `src/components/CONTEXT.md` — folder structure, naming, forms, hooks
- Contexts: `src/contexts/CONTEXT.md` — layers, use cases, server functions, dependency rules
- Shared: `src/shared/CONTEXT.md` — auth, cache, observability, testing
- Routes: `src/routes/CONTEXT.md` — loaders, mutations, auth guards, staleTime
- Plan: `docs/plan/plan.md` — remaining phases (10–22)
- ADRs: `docs/adr/`
